## v2.14.0, 2023-10-XX

### Highlights

Hacktoberfest release! üéâ

* MongoDB driver has been updated to v4.17.0

* You can now set `DISABLE_SOCKJS_CORS=1` if you want to prevent SockJS from setting CORS headers. Do not set this option if you will have DDP clients from other origins connecting to the DDP server. [PR #12789]

* Added guide on [how to prepare for Meteor 3.0 migration](https://guide.meteor.com/prepare-meteor-3.0).

* New DDP merge strategy `NO_MERGE_MULTI`, which is similar to `NO_MERGE`, but it does track whether a document is used by multiple publications. [PR #12742]

* Appcache has been further deprecated and moved to the deprecated packages folder.

* Added `Accounts.createUserAsync` into the client.

* Many packages had their underscore dependency removed.

* Cordova has been updated to v12.0.1 for Android and v7.0.1 for iOS

* `meteor create` command is now interactive!

#### Migration Steps

##### Android splash screen
If you have been using `splash-screen` for Cordova, you need to update your code as Android changed their splash screen API, 
the `cordova-plugin-splashscreen` is now on `cordova-android` core, so we have removed the dependency from the `splash-screen` 
package. As a result we are dropping the support for dark mode splash screen on Android.

To create this now you need to create two themes on your `config.xml` file.

>  Note that it's still possible to have it by adding the according themes with App.appendToConfig and App.addResourceFile - but this is not something Meteor will do automagically right now.

TODO: @matheusccastroo sample on how the new config should look and link to relevant Cordova docs 

## Breaking Changes

* `splash-screen` package has removed the `cordova-plugin-splashscreen` dependency. See migration steps for more info.
